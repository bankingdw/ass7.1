Create a sample dataset and implement the below Pig commands on the same dataset.

1) Concat
The CONCAT() function of Pig Latin is used to concatenate two or more expressions of the same type.

2) Tokenize
The TOKENIZE() function of Pig Latin is used to split a string (which contains a group of words) in a single tuple and returns a bag which contains the output of the split operation.

3) Sum
The SUM() function of Pig Latin to get the total of the numeric values of a column in a single-column bag. While computing the total, the SUM() function ignores the NULL values.

4) Min
The MIN() function of Pig Latin is used to get the minimum (lowest) value (numeric or chararray) for a certain column in a single-column bag. While calculating the minimum value, the MIN() function ignores the NULL values.

5) Max
The Pig Latin MAX() function is used to calculate the highest value for a column (numeric values or chararrays) in a single-column bag. While calculating the maximum value, the Max() function ignores the NULL values.

6) Limit
The LIMIT operator is used to get a limited number of tuples from a relation.

7) Store
Storing the loaded data in the file system using the store operator.

8) Distinct
The DISTINCT operator is used to remove redundant (duplicate) tuples from a relation.

9) Flatten
An operator that changes the structure of tuples and bags in a way that a UDF cannot. Flatten un-nests tuples as well as bags. The idea is the same, but the operation and result is different for each type of structure.

10) IsEmpty
The IsEmpty() function of Pig Latin is used to check if a bag or map is empty.
